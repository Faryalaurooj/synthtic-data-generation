# synthtic-data-generation
In this repo , we will use SInGAN to harmonize the synthtic data to make it look real . In addressing the challenge of aircraft detection and recognition in satellite imagery, where access to comprehensive real-world datasets is limited, a novel approach was pursued involving the seamless
integration of synthetic aircraft patches into real satellite images. This integration process is facilitated by a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), which effectively harmonized the synthetic elements with the visual characteristics and contextual nuances present in the real data through style transfer techniques. Subsequently, a Deep Learning (DL) model is deployed to conduct aircraft
prediction tasks, wherein various proportions of synthetic and real data were mixed.
